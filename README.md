## Inspiration
As children / grandchildren of immigrants, we've seen members of our family struggle to assimilate and meet new people. Our project is perfect for helping those in similar situations. It gives them the opportunity to share parts of their culture that they love while teaching and engaging with enthusiastic members of their community. With this website, it will be easier than ever for people of all walks of life to feel included and loved in their communities. 

## What it does
Our projects allows people to learn about other cultures, learn new skills, engage with their community, and can even help those who are food-insecure. Users can host and attend events to teach or learn about foods from different cultures. Additionally, this program provides food-insecure people with a path to a wide variety of foods while simultaneously contributing and patriating in their local communities. 

## How we built it
We used Next.js to build out the frontend and backend of our web app. For storage, we decided to use MongoDB because of it's JSON-like nature. And finally, we deployed our project to Vercel because of it's simple integrations with GitHub.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges connecting to and reading from MongoDB, however, after several hours of troubleshooting, we were able to read the necessary data. We also ran into challenges styling our website, but we're still happy with the final result.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our execution of an idea we came up with just yesterday. Despite being very early in its development, we truly believe CulinaryCommunity has the ability to change the world for the bette by making it more inclusive, understanding, and culturally aware.

## What we learned
As a result of this project, we've had to think about how to make services as accessible and inclusive as possible. This involves addressing issues that affect immigrants, people of low-income, those physically disconnected from others, and much more. 

## What's next for CulinaryCommunity
Ideally, we would love to partner with companies like HelloFresh, Google Meet, and Zoom. Partnerships with these brands would allow us to deliver food to user's directly, further improving accessibility, reducing waste, and connecting people from all over the globe.
